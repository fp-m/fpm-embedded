FP/M is an experimental embedded operating system designed for modern microprocessors.
The name stands for "Flash Program for Microcontrollers."
It aims to provide a lightweight and efficient environment for developing embedded applications,
drawing inspiration from historical operating systems like CP/M and PC DOS.

The kernel API is designed for direct execution of binary executables
from a primary Flash file system. User interaction occurs primarily through
a command-line interface (CLI). An optional SD card slot may be included
for file transfer and additional storage.
